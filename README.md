### Number Converter Calculator in C++

This C++ program implements a versatile Number Converter Calculator that allows conversion between decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal number systems. It provides a console-based interface for users to select their desired conversion type and input numbers accordingly.

#### Features:

1. **Supported Conversions:**
   - **Decimal:** Convert decimal numbers to binary, octal, and hexadecimal.
   - **Binary:** Convert binary numbers to decimal, octal, and hexadecimal.
   - **Octal:** Convert octal numbers to decimal, binary, and hexadecimal.
   - **Hexadecimal:** Convert hexadecimal numbers to decimal, binary, and octal.

2. **User Interface:**
   - **Color-coded Menus:** Differentiates conversion categories using distinct colors for clarity (e.g., blue for binary, green for octal).
   - **Interactive Input:** Prompts users to enter their choice of conversion and the corresponding number to convert.
   - **Loading Feedback:** Provides visual and auditory loading feedback using the `espeak` command for a more engaging user experience.

3. **Implementation Details:**
   - **Switch Statements:** Utilizes nested switch statements to handle menu selections and specific conversion choices.
   - **System Commands:** Integrates system commands (`system("cls")`) to clear the console screen and maintain a clean interface.
   - **Error Handling:** Includes basic error handling for invalid user inputs to ensure the program runs smoothly.

#### Usage:

- Upon running the program, users are presented with a main menu where they can choose the type of number conversion they wish to perform.
- Each conversion type (decimal, binary, octal, hexadecimal) offers further sub-options based on the direction of conversion.
- Users enter the number they wish to convert and receive the converted result directly on the console.

#### Dependencies:

- The program uses the `espeak` command for auditory feedback, which may require installation depending on the operating system.
- Standard C++ libraries such as `<iostream>`, `<sstream>`, `<cstring>`, and `<cmath>` are used for basic operations and string manipulations.

#### Future Enhancements:

- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for improved user interaction and visual feedback.
- Add support for additional number systems or custom bases beyond the standard decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal.
- Enhance error handling and input validation to handle edge cases more effectively.

#### Notes:

This project serves as a practical implementation of number system conversions using C++, providing a foundational understanding of bitwise operations and numeric representations. It is suitable for educational purposes and can be expanded based on specific requirements or additional functionalities desired.
